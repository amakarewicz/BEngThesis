            <h2>Testing algorithm parameters</h2>
            <p>In this application, the user can perform clustering of European countries using chosen algorithm and parameters. The following report presents the behaviour of the algorithms based on chosen parameters.</p>

                <p>In the figure below, there are presented K-Means and Agglomerative clustering algorithmsâ€™ results for a different number of chosen clusters measured by one of the three available evaluation metrics.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>K-Means results in most cases are worse than Agglomerative clustering results. It proposes the worst groupings according to the Silhouette score and Dunn index values. The only measure that favours K-Means is Calinski-Harabasz Index which indicates that the K-Means algorithm groups similar countries in one cluster but does not necessarily separate clusters in a proper way. The best number of clusters for K-Means is 3 or 4.</li>
                    <li>The best Agglomerative clustering variants are complete-linkage and average-linkage clusterings. The complete-linkage variant assigns more similar countries to one cluster (according to the Calinski-Harabasz index) while the average-linkage variant proposes better-separated clusters (according to the Dunn index). Furthermore, the complete-linkage variant achieves more stable results. Same as for K-Means, Agglomerative clustering results suggest choosing 3 or 4 clusters.</li>

                <p>Chart on the right presents the grouping resulting from Agglomerative clustering model, with complete linkage and number of clusters set to 4. Grouping was performed on the 10 year intervals (10 year back from the value shown on the slider), to observe the changes happening in the economic indicators' values and their similarity between countries. As it can be observed, in the 1998, a year before the founding of the eurozone, <i>core</i> European countries, which accepted the new currency, are clustered together. It is explainable, given the fact that there's a list of requirements concerning country's economy, to join the eurozone. There is also a cluster formed by the previous eastern block countries. Going forward to 2007, which was three years after many countries joined the EU and some of them also the eurozone, there is no longer clear separation of those countries - they start to synchronize with more developed countries.</p>

                <p>Because the DBSCAN algorithm does not provide an option to choose a number of clusters, its results are presented in a separate figure. Dark green represents outliers that should not be included in any cluster. DBSCAN creates from 1 to 3 clusters depending on chosen parameters. Choosing a bigger limit of the minimum number of countries forming a cluster (min samples) leads to an increasing number of outliers. Choosing a bigger eps parameter leads to creating a smaller number of clusters.</p>
