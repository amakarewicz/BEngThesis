        <p>In this application, the user can perform clustering of European countries using chosen algorithm and parameters. The following report presents the behaviour of the algorithms based on chosen parameters.</p>

            <p>In the figure above, there are presented KMeans and Hierarchical algorithmsâ€™ results for a different number of chosen clusters measured by one of the three available evaluation metrics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>KMeans results in most cases are lower than Hierarchical results. It has the worst results for the Silhouette score and Dunn index. The only measure that favours KMeans is Calinski-Harabasz Index which means the KMeans algorithm groups similar countries in one cluster but does not necessarily separate clusters in a proper way. The best number of clusters for KMeans is 3 or 4.</li>
                <li>The best Hierarchical algorithm variants are complete and average. The "complete" variant has more similar countries in one cluster (according to the Calinski-Harabasz index) while the "average" variant has better-separated clusters (according to the Dunn index). Furthermore, the complete variant has more stable results. Like for KMeans, Hierarchical results suggest choosing 3 or 4 clusters.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Because the DBSCAN algorithm does not provide an option to choose a number of clusters, its results are presented in a separate figure. Burgundy and blue colours represent outliers that should not be included in any cluster. DBSCAN creates from 1 to 3 clusters depending on chosen parameters. Choosing a bigger limit of the minimum number of countries forming a cluster (min samples) leads to an increasing number of outliers. Choosing a bigger eps parameter leads to creating a smaller number of clusters.</p>
