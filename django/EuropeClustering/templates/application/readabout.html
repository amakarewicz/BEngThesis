                <h3>About us</h3>
                <p>Application has been created as part of Data Science diploma thesis on Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science. The aim of the diploma thesis is to apply various clustering algorithms to the time series of economic growth of European countries. The analyzed data is to be pre-processed using methods such as segmentation, normalization or anomaly removal. The results of the work are presented in this application written in Django, which allows the user to compare the indicators and clustering results for different countries and algorithms.</p>

                                    K-Means organizes points based on their distance from the cluster centre (centroid) and aims to minimize the distances between points within one cluster. Proposed implementation requires only one parameter to be passed by the user:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>n_clusters – number of clusters to form</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    The grouping is achieved by repeatedly relocating centroids and reassigning countries to the closest centres, which are firstly randomly initialized.

                                <td>Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical algorithm that groups the objects according to the “bottom-up” approach: firstly assigns each observation to its own cluster, and in the next steps, pairs of clusters that are closest to each other are recursively merged into one cluster. Proposed implementation requires two parameters to be passed by the user:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>n_clusters – number of clusters to form</li>

                                            <li>“complete” – maximum value of all pairwise distances between the elements in the first cluster and the elements in the second cluster</li>
                                            <li>“single” – minimum value of all pairwise distances between the elements in the first cluster and the elements in the second cluster</li>

                                <td>DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm, which detects areas of high point concentration separated by regions of the lower density of points. Proposed implementation requires two parameters to be passed by the user:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>eps – the maximum distance between two points to consider one as a part of the other’s neighbourhood</li>
                                        <li>min_samples – minimum number of points in the neighbourhood to consider the point as a part of the cluster; controls how tolerant the model is towards outliers </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Higher min_samples value or lower eps value indicate higher density necessary to form a cluster. DBSCAN groups points from the same neighbourhood, which range and density are defined by pa-rameters. The rest of the points that do not belong to any of the identified clusters are declared outliers.
